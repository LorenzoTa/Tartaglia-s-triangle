in the 'colorize by evaluation' you can also load external modules:

use Math::Prime::Util::GMP qw/sigma/; will load this wonderful module, so after you can:

sigma($_)>2*$_  
which shows the distribution of abundants number in the triangle: which seems interesting

OR 

use Math::Prime::Util::GMP qw/is_semiprime/;
is_semiprime($_)
